answer to first question 1.3 : The PCA plot suggest that there is not a batach effect on the tissue samples. This is because for the most part, each replicate is found to cluster around the same tissue type. For instance, tissue type P2.4 is found to cluster at the upper right of the plot alongside all its replicates. 
The only problem I see is there is a swap between some replicates in the Cu and FE tissues types (as some replicates are found in the wrong cluster). To fix this, I swapped the columns. 
answer to the second question 1.3:As we can see in the graph, A1 is on the most left and tissue P2.4 is the most on the right this means that this tissue contributes to the main source of variation captured by PC1. Additionally, the tissues are diveded into different clusters indicating differenct biological functions. Tissues are highly variable, as even the same genes in different tissues can have different expression outcomes. Also, this PCA plot is interesting as it provides information about spatial organization of the fly's gut. For instance, the features that explain the first principal component are the tissues, as A1 tissue is the first cluster observed, which is the first region of the fly's gut after the PV region. Then, following cluster A1, we observe A2 and A3 followed by Cu, which follows the same spatial organization in the fly's gut. 

question 3: since we are looking at a dataset from the midgut of a fly, it makese sense that cluster 2 is overrepresented with protein processing genes, as these cells need to be able with the fly's digestion, enzye secretion etc. 
Additionally, there was high values in cluster 1 observed in metabolic activity and transport and secretation, which can reflect the cellular/physiological processing occur in the flys gut.
