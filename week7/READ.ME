answer to first question 1.3 : The PCA plot suggest that there is not a batach effect on the tissue samples. This is because for the most part, each replicate is found to cluster around the same tissue type. For instance, tissue type P2.4 is found to cluster at the upper right of the plot alongside all its replicates. 
The only problem I see is there is a swap between some replicates in the Cu and FE tissues types (as some replicates are found in the wrong cluster). However, I wonder if this can indicate similar biological function of the tissue type.  
answer to the second question 1.3: The features that explain the first principal component are the expression of genes (mostly expressed). FOr instance, genes in the dataset like FBgn0030098 have that largest expression and contribute to this plot, and these genes are expressed differently in different tissues. 

question 3: since we are looking at a dataset from the midgut of a fly, it makese sense that cluster 2 is overrepresented with protein processing genes, as these cells need to be able with the fly's digestion, enzye secretion etc. 
Additionally, there was high values in cluster 1 observed in metabolic activity and transport and secretation, which can reflect the cellular/physiological processing occur in the flys gut.
