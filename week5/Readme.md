Step 2.2:
Question 1: The slope for this linear model is 0.38, a positive yet slow increase. In plain language, this
means that maternal DNMs increase roughly ~0.38 every year of materanl age. Therefore, it does match out plot, as visually, we see a slight increase trend in the data. 
Question 2: Yes, it is significant. The p value is <2e-16 ***, which is very low. This means that the observations we are seeing most likely did not happen by chance, therefore, maternal age tends is a good predictor of maternal DNMs. 

Step 2.3:
Question 1: The slope for this linear model is 1.35, a postive yet steeper slope. This means that paternal DNMs increase roughly ~1.35 units every year of paternal age. Therefore, it does match our plot as our plot has a much faster postive slope (when compared to the mother plot)
Question 2: Yes, it is significant. The p value is <2e-16 ***, which is very low. This means that the observations we are seeing most likely did not happen by chance, therefore, paternal age is a good predictor of paternal DNMs

step 2.4:
The prediction for the expected number of paternal DNMs for a 50.5 year old father is 78.69546 so ~79 DNMs. 

Step 2.5:
T-test interpretation : There is about ~61 more paternal DNMa than maternal DNMS per proband. Additionally, this test shows that difference between paternal and marternal DNMs are significantly different since the P value is p-value < 2.2e-16.In terms of the graph, the paternal number of DNMS is much higher than the maternal DNMs, corresponding to these values in the t-test. 

lm model: in this case, the intercept is reported as 45.2 which means the father contributes ~45 more DNMs than the mother per proband. Additionally, the P value is <2e-16 ***, extremely low, indicating this is a very significant difference. 

Difference between models: From these results, I can say both tests models are equivalent to each other because we are looking at the difference between the two groups and how different it is from the zero point. 

I will be doing step Week 5 Step 3.3 on the first graph I did. I want to see if 
there is a relationship between budget and ratings of horror movies. I hypothesize the horror movies with a more expensive
budget have a higher review rating. 

According to the model, this model does not fit well. First, the R square is about 0.37% which means budget explains only 0.37% of the variation in review rating. 
Aditionally, there is a 1.653 residual standard error meaning our predications are off quite a bit. Therefore, although the model works and the pvalue is below 0.05, it doesn't represent/explain the data well. However, based off this model, it suggest that horror movie budgets have a slight positive correlation with reivew raitings (but it's a vary small effect, that could be explained by other factors other than budget).
