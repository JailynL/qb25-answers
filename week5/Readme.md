Step 2.2:
Question 1: The slope for this linear model is 0.38, a positive yet slow increase. In plain language, this
means that maternal DNMs increase roughly ~0.38 every year of materanl age. Therefore, it does match out plot, as visually, we see a slight increase trend in the data. 
Question 2: Yes, it is significant. The p value is <2e-16 ***, which is very low. This means that the observations we are seeing most likely did not happen by chance, therefore, maternal age tends is a good predictor of maternal DNMs. 

Step 3.3 
Question 1: The slope for this linear model is 1.35, a postive yet steeper slope. This means that paternal DNMs increase roughly ~1.35 units every year of paternal age. Therefore, it does match our plot as our plot has a much faster postive slope (when compared to the mother plot)
Question 2: Yes, it is significant. The p value is <2e-16 ***, which is very low. This means that the observations we are seeing most likely did not happen by chance, therefore, paternal age is a good predictor of paternal DNMs
